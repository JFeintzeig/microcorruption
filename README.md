# Microcorruption

While at the Recurse Center in Winter '23-'24, I worked through the [microcorruption](https://microcorruption.com) CTF. It's a binary reverse engineering CTF focused on exploiting firmware on a digital lock. It covers techniques including:

 - Stack-based buffer overflows
 - String format vulnerabilities
 - Integer overflow vulnerabilities
 - Heap-based overflows / memory allocator corruption
 - Bypassing protections including ASLR and DEP
 - Some hashing/crypto shenanagins

It took me ~150+ hours of work, but I successfully solved all 24 levels. This repo contains the raw data of my solutions, and a few hacky scripts I made for a few levels.
